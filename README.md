# SCons

[SCons](https://scons.org/) is an open-source software construction tool designed to automate the building of software projects. It acts as a powerful alternative to traditional build tools like `make`. SCons is written in Python and uses Python scripts (`SConscript`) as configuration files, providing flexibility and ease of use.

### Key Features of SCons:
- **Dependency Tracking**: Automatically detects changes in source files and rebuilds only what is necessary.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- **Ease of Use**: Configuration files are Python scripts, allowing for dynamic and reusable build logic.
- **Automatic Builds**: SCons includes a built-in dependency scanner, so you don't have to manually define dependencies.

### Why Use SCons?
- If you're managing complex builds involving multiple source files, SCons simplifies the process.
- Itâ€™s extensible, making it ideal for projects that require custom build rules.
- With Python as its configuration language, SCons allows you to write flexible and robust build scripts.

### Example Usage
To build a C++ project with SCons:
1. Create an `SConscript` file to define the build rules.
2. Run `scons` in the terminal to build the project.
